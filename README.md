Amazon Clone
This project is a frontend clone of Amazon, built using HTML and CSS to replicate the look and feel of the original website. It features a fully responsive design, a structured homepage, a navigation bar with a static search bar, and well-organized product sections. The goal of this project is to practice and improve frontend development skills by creating a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

ðŸš€ Current Status: This project is fully functional with HTML and CSS. JavaScript and React will be added later to enhance interactivity and functionality, such as an add-to-cart system, user authentication, and dynamic content updates.

Future updates will include animations, interactive elements, and backend integration to make the project more realistic and engaging. Stay tuned for improvements! ðŸŽ¯
